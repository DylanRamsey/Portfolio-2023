TLDR: There’s a very active discord server for Software Developers and other tech workers local to Sarasota that’s a great resource and community space for anyone who works in tech that lives in the Sarasota area.
What has to be my favorite thing I’ve built as a developer, didn’t take a single line of code. It’s the Sarasota Software Developers Discord server, an online community space for tech workers that live in the Sarasota Florida area. Since the two years I first spun up the server, it has turned into an incredible place full of smart, talented, and passionate Software Developers and other tech workers local to Sarasota.
There’s hundreds of other discord servers that exist as communities for developers, but I created the Sarasota Software Developers server because I thought it’d be immensely valuable to have a local online community. A community of developers that you could interact with online, and offline. That’s exactly what the server has become, even beyond my initial dreams for it. Two years since its initial creation, we now have over 100 members and it’s a vibrant and active space with daily ongoing discussions about Software, tech, and even just the personal lives and happenings of our members.
The server isn’t just a place for tech discussion, but also serves as a career resource for those working in tech or have an interest in working in tech within the Sarasota area. There’s channels for local tech job postings, one that’s a directory of companies within the Sarasota area that hires tech workers, and a channel for career advice just to name a few. Even outside these channels in the general discussion space, there are so many talented and experienced developers that are more than happy to share their knowledge and advice.
